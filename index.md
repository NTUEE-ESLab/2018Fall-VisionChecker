# 2018Fall-VisionChecker

## Introduction

As technology grows speedily, people start giving more and more tasks to machines, saving human resources for more valuable missions. We observed that one of the common replacable job is operating the vision check in usual eye clinics. Our goal is to build a device that can auto detect the hand movemet of the user and calculate the correponding vision level of the tester.

## Features
1. Light-weighted. Easy to setup and doesn't require special equipments.
2. Can be operated by the tester himself. Doesn't require one more operator.
3. The application loops itself and doesn't require setup time when switching users.

## Usage
1. Turn on the device. Sit at about 2 meters apart, right in front of the camera.
2. After seeing **WELCOME**, press the button to start up.
3. Adjust your post so that your image is in the middle of the screen.
4. Start the Vision test! Wave your hand to increase the accuracy of detection.
5. After the test is finished, your result will be shown on the screen.
6. Press button to restart for the next user.
